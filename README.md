# BankingApp

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.13.
I have imported Bootstrap as part of the assignment requirements in the project. Please find the project and download it, and run it in your local computer.

Keep in mind that I have used local storage for storing the user data, so you might need to clear the local storage in the localhost to run it from the start for every time.

I would really appreciate the opportunity to talk more about this project and the decisions that I have taken while building this application over an interview. I look forward to hearing back from you.
